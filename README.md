# IPSoftQATest
This project is an automated testing application which will open up Firefox browser and go to Wikipedia page and select English and will 
check if its on the English version.
Serenitiy-Jbehave-archetype was used to create the Maven project.
I am using a Firefox driver for this application.Since, from Firefox 47 it uses Marionette driver(gecko engine), so I have used Firefox 46.09
version to work with my firefox driver.
Here is the link of the browser I have used.One can download this version and use to run the application --
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/46.0b9/win64/en-US/

To run the application:
1.Clone/Download the project(IPSoftQATest) into your local repository from github.
2.Import the project into your IDE(I have used Eclipse).
3.Once imported, inside the IDE right click on the project and Run as JUnit Test.
4.The application will start.
5.It will open up the firefox browser and do the required testings.
6.Please refer to version(or lower versions) of the firefox browser mentioned above for this application to run smoothly.
7.Once all the tests passed it will show in the console - Test Passed.
